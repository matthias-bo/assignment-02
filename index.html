    <h2>Who was Alan Turing?</h2>
    <p style="font-size:140%;">Amongst the many computer scientist who lived long before us, there is one who was special in particular, and deserves a tribute to.
    That man is Alan Turing. Now he might be an unfamiliar name, and many would wonder, who was Alan Turing? Alan Turing was once an mathematician,
    computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
    He was originally famous for developing the idea of a modern computer, and how it should function. He was also known for inventing the idea of
    artificial intelligence alongside a certain John McCarthy, but Alan would soon die before he could see the first AI program which came out in 1956.
    During World War II, he was tasked with breaking the enigma code of the Nazi radio signals, which he accomplished.
    Under the words of Winston Churchill, Turing shortened the war by a possible 2 years.</p>
    <h3>The life of a computer genius</h3>
    <p>Alan Turing was born in a small city in Britain named Maida Vale, London on June 23, 1912. Alan's father was Julius Turing, and his mother was Sara Ethel Turing.
    During the time of Alan's birth, his father was on leave from his position at the ICS (Indian Civil Service). When Turing was young, he was 
    immediately recognized of his talent from his teachers when he was enrolled at St.Michael's elementary school. From there, he moved to the 
    Sherborne public school. When Turing was 16, he would continue to solve extremely advanced problems without even having the basic knowledge of
    calculus. Despite Turing's remarkable abilities to solve advanced problems, he did not gain any respect from his teachers or peers for the reason
    that, he wasn't solving the basic questions that his grade would learn.
