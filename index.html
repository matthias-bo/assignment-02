    <h2>Who was Alan Turing?</h2>
    <p>Amongst the many computer scientist who lived long before us, there is one who was special in particular, and deserves a tribute to. 
    That man is Alan Turing. Now he might be an unfamiliar name, and many would wonder, who was Alan Turing? Alan Turing was once an mathematician, 
    computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.
    He was originally famous for developing the idea of a modern computer, and how it should function. He was also known for inventing the idea of 
    artificial intelligence alongside a certain John McCarthy, but Alan would soon die before he could see the first AI program which came out in 1956. 
    During World War II, he was tasked with breaking the enigma code of the Nazi radio signals, which he accomplished.
    Under the words of Winston Churchill, Turing shortened the war by a possible 2 years.</p>
